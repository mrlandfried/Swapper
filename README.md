 

Your task is to complete a method that swaps adjacent values in an array of integers. For example, if the array contains the values

```
1 4 9 16 25 36
```

then after calling the method, it should contain the values

```
4 1 16 9 36 25
```

If the array contains an odd number of elements, leave the last element in place. For example,

```
1 4 9 16 25 36 45
```

becomes

```
4 1 16 9 36 25 45
```
